# agrbl32
This is a fork of usbcnc/grbl (https://github.com/usbcnc/grbl) which is a fork of gnea/grbl (https://github.com/gnea/grbl) porting it to the STM32F1 architechture. Compilation is command line based using gnu make and gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update. Tested on Mac OS X using the STM32duino bootloader from (https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/STM32duino-bootloader/blob/master/updater_stm32f1/updater_stm32f1.ino) on a Maple Mini clone.

Code is uploaded (make download) using the USB port and dfu-util ver 0.9 installed via MacPorts.
